I am a prospective Graduate Student [Department of Computer Science](https://www.ndsu.edu/cs/) at North Dakota State University. 
I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from Sylhet Engineering College affiliated with SUST, Bangladesh.
Here is my full [CV](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Zrlsycne2BANjqria1rf8HM7IO4fWs5R?usp=sharing).


This portfolio is under construction. Thanks for visiting.
